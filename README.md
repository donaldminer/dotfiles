# My Dotfiles
This is a partial config for my current workspace dotfiles, more will be added in the future.
## Components
### Miniconda
- Using conda-incubator/conda-zsh-completion for completion functionality in Zsh.
### NeoVim
- A Config based heavily on [Josean Martinez's](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files) setup using Lazy as the plugin manager, with some AI Snippets using Codeium.
### Tmux
### Xresources
- I am using [URXVT with true color support](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs) as my terminal.
### Zsh
- The structure of the config files for zsh are based on [Zach Holman's](https://github.com/holman) dotfiles structure.
- Zinit is used for plugin management.
- Powerlevel10k is for prompt configuration.
### Theme
- All color schemes are from (rebelot/kanagawa.nvim)[https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim] specifically the Dragon theme.
